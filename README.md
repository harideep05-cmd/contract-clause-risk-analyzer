# Contract Clause Risk Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a contract intelligence prototype that extracts high-risk legal clauses
(Confidentiality, Termination, Liability) and generates risk-focused summaries and
qualitative severity ratings using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Problem
Manual contract review is slow and error-prone due to complex legal language.
Non-legal stakeholders often struggle to understand contractual risks.

## Solution
- Uses labeled legal data to identify critical clauses
- Applies an LLM for plain-English risk summarization
- Assigns qualitative risk severity (Low / Medium / High) to prioritize review

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Gemini LLM
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## Risk Severity Disclaimer
Risk severity is a qualitative estimate generated by the LLM based on clause language.
It is intended to assist review, not replace legal judgment.

## Limitations
- English-only contracts
- Clause-level analysis (not full contract parsing)
- Severity is heuristic, not legally authoritative

## Future Improvements
- Automatic clause detection from raw contracts
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Confidence scoring
